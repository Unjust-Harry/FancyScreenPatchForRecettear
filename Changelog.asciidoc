= Fancy Screen Patch for Recettear =

== Changelog ==

=== Version 1.0.3 ===

* A now-dead URL that was used for downloading Special K is no longer used.
* The error handling that was supposed to try alternative URLs when a file download failed was fixed. (According to `Invoke-WebRequest`, `-ErrorAction Continue` actually means "explode and stop").
* Four "archive.org" fallback URLs were changed such that they serve the actual files to PowerShell.

=== Version 1.0.2 ===

* A bug, which was introduced by version 1.0.1, that caused pillarboxes and letterboxes drawn by the patch to not draw sometimes was fixed.

=== Version 1.0.1 ===

* A bug that caused the texture-filtering algorithm option for `FPSOSD` to also, wrongly, apply to the pillarboxes drawn by the patch was fixed.
